                    A gas giant is a large planet mostly composed of helium and/or hydrogen.
                    These planets, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system, don’t have hard surfaces and instead have swirling gases above a solid core.
                    Gas giant exoplanets can be much larger than Jupiter, and much closer to their stars than anything found in our solar system.
                    Gas giants, like Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system, are composed mostly of helium and/or hydrogen.
                    Gas giants nearer to their stars are often called “hot Jupiters.”
                </p>
                <p>Facts:</p>
                <li>51 peg b was the first planet discovered around a sun-like star in 1995.</li>
                <li>It is thought they form within the first million years of a sun-like star’s life…or not at all.</li>
                <li>Hot Jupiters orbit so close to their stars that their temperatures soar into the thousands of degrees.</li>
                <li>KELT-9 b, the hottest gas giant found so far, is hotter than most stars.</li>

                    In our solar system, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus are terrestrial, or rocky, planets.
                    For planets outside our solar system, those between half of Earth’s size to twice its radius are 
                    considered terrestrial. Terrestrial planets are rocky worlds, composed of rock, silicate, water, and/or carbon.
                </p>
                <p>Facts:</p>
                <li>There could be more than 10 billion terrestrial planets across our galaxy.</li>
                <li>The 7 Earth-size planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are thought to be terrestrial (4 are super-Earth size).</li>
                <li>Habitable terrestrial planets may be present in binary (two-star) systems.</li>
                <li>Kepler-11b is a terrestrial planet 10 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun.</li>

                    Neptunian exoplanets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus in our solar system.
                    Neptunian planets typically have hydrogen and helium-dominated atmospheres with cores of rock and heavier metals.
                </p>
                <p>Facts:</p>
                <li>In 2014, researchers discovered the first ice giant exoplanet 25,000 light years away.</li>
                <li>An enormous comet-like cloud of hydrogen is bleeding off of a warm, Neptune-sized exoplanet.</li>
                <li>Neptune-sized worlds may be more likely to form in the icy outer reaches of planetary systems.</li>

                    Super-Earths – a class of planets unlike any in our solar system –
                    are more massive than Earth yet lighter than ice giants like Neptune and Uranus, and can be made of gas, 
                    rock or a combination of both.
                </p>
                <p>Facts:</p>
                <li>Kepler-452b was the first Earth-size planet discovered around a near solar twin.</li>
                <li>Kepler-22b is a super-Earth that could be covered in a super ocean.</li>
                <li>A super-Earth planet could be hiding at the edge of our own solar system.</li>
                <li>There’s a super-Earth exoplanet with temperatures hot enough to vaporize metal.</li>
